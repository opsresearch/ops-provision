# Ops-Provision
Dead-Easy Provisioning and Configuration

Do you ever need to install software on a variety of computers where the trouble of an enterprise-grade provisioner isnâ€™t justified? Where all you really need is a bash script.

I do quite often and had copies of similar scripts spread across several projects.

The obvious thing was to consolidate the scripts and share them across the concerns. This reduces my maintenance effort and lets me focus some of the efficiency on better provisioning.

The resulting project is Ops-Provision, a collection of free-open-source bash scripts licensed under the MIT License.

If you need simple bash-driven provisioning in your project, I hope you will give it a try, and you find it useful.
